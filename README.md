## About this project

An open source, interactive Web-based toolkit for arts organizations seeking new models for community development, diverse participation, and sustainable practice. Preserving the policies, methods and knowledge that has put Toronto at the forefront of artist-centred, equitable game arts culture, the ComDev Kit will create a space and mechanism for sharing and collaboration amongst organizers and volunteers involved in other initiatives across the sector.
